healthy <- read.csv("data/healthy.csv", header = FALSE)
str(healthy)  # 566 x 646
healthyMatrix <- as.matrix(healthy)

str(healthyMatrix)
# It is 566 x 646- larger than the Flower image.

#steps for Hierarchichal Clustering
#1. Compute the Distance Matrix
distance <- dist(healthyVector, method="euclidian")

str(healthyVector)
# This vector has a huge number of elements.
n = 365636

# For R to calculate pairwise distances, it will actually need to calculate n * (n-1)/2 of these values and store them in the Distance matrix.


n * (n-1)/2
# This computes quite a huge value which is the reason for R to compain of storing such a big matrix.
# Hierarchical Clustering therefore, cannot be used here with the MRI image Clustering.

# Another alternate Approach? - KMeans

#Step 1: Choose number of Clusters.
k = 5

# Step 2 : Randomly assign each data point to a Cluster
# Step 3: Compute Cluster Centroids
# Step 4: Re- assign the data point to nearest Cluster mean.
# Step 5: Re-compute Cluster centroids.
# Step 6: Go back to Step 4, and repeat till 5 until no replacements are made.

#First parameter of the Output- Cluster vector assigns each element in the healthy vector to a Cluster

healthyClusters = kmc$cluster

# mean intensity values of each Cluster can be seen using the centers function, which needed using mean with tapply in case of Hierarchical.
kmc$centers

#All the centers are < 0.5, which tells they are close to Zero, and hence Darker.

# output the segmented image, but first convert the healthy clusters vector into a matrix

dim(healthyClusters) <- c(nrow(healthyMatrix), ncol(healthyMatrix))

tumorMatrix <- as.matrix(tumor)
tumorVector <- as.vector(tumorMatrix)

# we wont run the Kmeans on Tumor vector again- Treat healthy vector as a training set, and tumor as a Test Set.
# load flexclust package.
library(flexclust)

#flexclust contains object type kcca- which is k centroid cluster analysis
#we need to convert the information from Clustering algorithm to the object of Class KCCA

kmc.kcca = as.kcca(kmc, healthyVector)

# Cluster the pixles in Tumor vector using the predict function.
tumorClusters <- predict(kmc.kcca, newdata = tumorVector)
